# Component
just a Component-based game engine.
Example usage: `python2 -m Component.lfclone.lfclone`


Most of the implementation of the engine is contained in:
* `component.py`
* `components.py`

but the example usage of that engine is within `lfclone.py`
to run `lfclone.py` you'll need:
* `animation.py`
* `constants.json`
* `keyconfig.json`
* `vector.py`

as well
