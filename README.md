Platformer
==========
just a game platform engine i'm working on.

the important things are in:
* component.py
* components.py

but to run lfclone.py you need:
* animation.py
* lf_constants.json
* lf_keyconfig.json
* vector.py

and obviously, lfclone.py

go to the wiki for the documentation

deps:
* python 2.7 (not python 3)
* pygame>=1.9.1
